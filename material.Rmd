# Material Design
This lecture discusses [Material design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html): the _design language_ ??introduced by Google as a unified style for their applications.?? The design language focuses on mobile designs (e.g., for Android), but can also be used across platforms (e.g., on the web through [css frameworks]()).

## The Material Design Language [20-30min]
**principles**
https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles
- based on "materials": in particular, idea of surfaces (pieces of paper) floating in space
    - paper is "light card stock" (35lb weight)
- aesthetic choices (color, fonts, etc)
- motion within a single environment: content moves and reorganizes in response to user input

**Material Properties** (e.g., the "materials")
https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/material-properties.html#
- uniform thickness (1dp), but at different elevations (depths)
  - shadows to indicate elevation
  - don't occupy same space!
- can change shape, size, position (along plane); but doesn't fold; can split and rejoin
- motion/interaction: inputs stay within material, material doesn't pass through materials
  - can move on any axis, but z-axis (up and down) is for user interaction!

>> do I include/link show these animations? maybe in class, not in the reading
>> could show 10-minute video in class? Probably faster actually


**Elevation**
https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/elevation-shadows.html#
- default resting elevation; change depth in response to user inputs
- table of default elevations!! (w/ images)
- shadows are used to indicate the elevation
- Helps to indicate _perspective_ (perspective image from graphics??)

**Object Hierarchy**; group visual components into hierarchy (parent-child), with some rules:
- children move with parent (e.g., scrolling); includes transformations (scales, elevation changes, etc)
- children have minimal elevation diff from parents, and other objects don't get inserted inbetween
> this may not correspond to an actual View hierarchy (??)

...

??specific widgets??


## Implementing Material [30-40min]
//only available in Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher! Can get some pieces in lower APIs with backwards compatibility, but need to do some work https://developer.android.com/training/material/compatibility.html

**Material Theme** //cover in lab previously
- how to specify theme (what gets covered in lab next week??)
- customizing colors in lab?
>> will need app with some widgets to look at (maybe the input demo??)

**Lists and Cards** [20min?]
- implementing RecyclerView??
- Providing a card view
>> should include this as well...

**Assigning Elevation** [5-10min]
- e.g., demo for buttons! (elevation + translation)
- how to change shape??
  - can move from rectangle to circle automatically? Check the `Outline` class...

**Animations** [30min? or skip?? (come back to later)]
- include some defaults (demo??)
- Do these need to be specified?
  - reveal
- transitions (e.g., between Fragments) are neat!
-
does Property Animation go here?... I think so (at least interpolation as a piece)... or do that set of transitions later (lab?)

**Drawables** ??
- meh


## Design Support Library [30-40mins]
- Floating Action Button [5min] << could be something to modify/demo with!
- Navigation Drawer (via support library; vs. v4 library? _what's the difference?_)
  - Not too bad: filling in XML (20min?)
