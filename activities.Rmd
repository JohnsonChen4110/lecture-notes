# Activities and Logging
This lecture introduces [Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/index.html), which are the basic component used in Android applications. It aims to demonstrate how the interactive patterns used in other [graphical applications](#java-swing) are utilized in Android.

<p class="alert alert-info">This lecture references code found at <https://github.com/info448-s17/lecture02-activities>, in the `android/` folder. As a first step, you'll need to create a new Android application with a single **Empty** Activity (e.g., `MainActivity`). Future chapters will have starter code to work from, but it is good practice to make a new application from scratch!<p>

According to Google:

> An Activity is an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something.

You can think of an Activity as a single _screen_ in your app, the equivalent of a "window" in a GUI system (or a `JFrame` in a Swing app). Note that Activities don't __need__ to be full screens: they can also be floating modal windows, embedded inside other Activities (like half a screen), etc. But we'll begin by thinking of them as full screens. We can have lots of Activities (screens) in an application, and they are loosely connected so we can easily move between them.

In many ways, an Activity is a "bookkeeping mechanism": a place to hold _state_ and _data_, and tell to Android what to show on the display. It functions much like a Controller (in [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) sense) in that regard!

Also to note from the documentation:

> An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.

which implies a design suggestion: Activities (screens) break up your App into "tasks". Each Activity can represent what a user is doing at one time. If the user does something else, that should be a different Activity (and so probably a different screen).

## Making Activities
We create our own activities by _subclassing_ (extending) the framework's [`Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html) class. We use **inheritance** to make a specialized type of `Activity` (similar to extending `JFrame` in Swing apps). By extending this class we inherit all of the methods that are needed to control how the Android OS interacts with the Activity.

If you look at the default Empty `MainActivity`, it actually subclasses [`AppCompatActivity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/AppCompatActivity.html), which is a already specialized kind of Activity that provides an [`ActionBar`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/ActionBar.html) (the toolbar at the top of the screen with the name of you app). If you change the class to just extend `Activity`, that bar disappears.

<p class="alert alert-info">To make this change, you will need to import the `Activity` class! The keyboard shortcut in Android Studio is `alt+return`, or you can do it by hand (look up the package)! You can also set Android Studio to automatically import classes you use.</p>

There are a number of other built-in `Activity` subclasses that we could subclass instead. We'll mention them as they become relevant. Many on the books have been deprecated in favor of **Fragments**, which are sort of like "sub-activities" that get nested in larger Activities. We'll talk about Fragments more in a letter lecture.

Other important point to note: does this activity have a **constructor** that we call? No! We never write code that **instantiates** our Activity (we never call `new MainActivity()`). There is no `main` method in Android. Activities are created and managed by the Android operating system when the app is launched.

## The Activity Lifecycle `r #[10min]`
Although we never call a constructor or `main`, Activities do have an _incredibly_ well-defined [lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html)&mdash;that is, a series of **events** that occur during usage (e.g., when the Activity is created, when it is stopped, etc).

When each of these events occur, Android executes a **callback method**, similar to how you call `actionPerformed()` to react to a "button press" event in Swing. We can **override** these methods in order to do special actions (read: run our own code) when these events occur.

What is the lifecycle?

![Lifecycle state diagram, from Google. See also an alternative, simplified diagram [here](http://developer.android.com/images/training/basics/basic-lifecycle.png).](img/activities/activity_lifecycle.png)

There are 7 "events" that occur in the Activity Lifecycle, which are designated by the _callback function_ that they execute:

- **`onCreate()`**: called when the Activity is **first** created/instantiated. This is where you initialize the UI (e.g., specify the layout to use), similar to what might go in a constructor.

- **`onStart()`**: called just before the Activity becomes **visible** to the user.

	The difference between `onStart()` and `onCreate()` is that `onStart()` can be called more than once (e.g., if you leave the Activity, thereby hiding it, and come back later to make it visible again).

- **`onResume()`**: called just before **user interaction** starts, indicating that the Activity is ready to be used! This is a little bit like when that Activity "has focus".

	While `onStart()` is called when the Activity becomes visible, `onResume()` is called when then it is ready for interaction. It is possible for an Activity to be visible but not interactive, such as if there is a modal pop-up in front of it (partially hiding it).

- **`onPause()`**: called when the system is about to start another Activity (so about to lose focus). This is the "mirror" of `onResume()`. _When paused, the activity stays visible!_

	This callback is usually used to _quickly and temporarily_ store unsaved changes (like saving an email draft in memory) or stop animations or video playback. The Activity may be being left (on its way out), but could just be losing focus.

- **`onStop()`**: called when the activity is no longer visible. (e.g., another Activity took over, but this also be because the Activity has been destroyed. This callback is a mirror of `onStart()`.

	This callback is where you should persist any state information (e.g., saving the user's document or game state). It is intended to do more complex "saving" work than `onPause()`.

- **`onRestart()`**: called when the Activity is coming back from a "stopped" state. This event allows you to run distinct code when the App is being "restarted", rather than created for the first time. It is the least commonly used callback.

- **`onDestroy()`**: called when the Activity is about to be closed. This can happen because the user ended the application, ___or___ (and this is important!) because the OS is trying to save memory and so kills the App.

	<p class="alert alert-info">Android apps run on devices with significant hardware constraints in terms of both memory and battery life. Thus the Android OS is very aggressive about not leaving Apps running "in the background". If it determines that an App is no longer necessary (such as because it has been hidden for a while), that App will be destroyed. Note that this destruction is unpredictable, as the "necessity" of an App being open is dependent on the OS's resource allocation rules.</p>

	The `onDestroy()` callback can do final app cleanup, but its better to have such functionality in `onPause()` or `onStop()`.

Note that apps may not need to use all of these callbacks! For example, if there is no difference between starting from scratch and resuming from stop, then you don't need an `onRestart()` (since `onStart()` goes in the middle). Similarly, `onStart()` may not be needed if you just use `onCreate()` and `onResume()`. But these lifecycles allow for more granularity and the ability to avoid duplicate code.

### Overriding the Callback Methods
In the default `MainActivity` the `onCreate()` callback has already been overridden for us, since that's where the layout is specified.

Notice that this callback takes a `Bundle` as a parameter. A [`Bundle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Bundle.html) is an object that stores **key-value** pairs, like a super-simple `HashMap` (or an Object in JavaScript, or dictionary in Python). Bundles can only hold basic types (numbers, Strings) and so are used for temporarily "bunding" _small_ amounts of information.

This `Bundle` parameter in particular stores information about the Activity's current state (e.g., what text they may have typed into a search box), so that if the App gets killed it can be restarted in the same state and the user won't notice that it was ever lost! The `Bundle` stores current layout information in it by default (if the Views have ids)&mdash;technically, it calls a `onSaveInstanceState()` callback for each View in the layout, and the provided Views that we utilize tend to save important state information (like entered text) already. See [Saving and restoring activity state](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html#saras) for details.

Also note that we call `super.onCreate()`. ___Always call up the inheritance chain!___. This allows the system-level behavior to continue without any problem.

We can also add other callbacks: for example, `onStart()` (see [the documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html#lc) for examples).

But how can we know if the lifecycle events are getting called?


## Logging & ADB `r #[10min]`
In Android, we can't use `System.out.println()` because we don't actually have a terminal to print to! More specifically, the device (which is where the application is running) doesn't have access to [standard out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29) (`stdout`), which is what Java means by `System.out`.

- It is possible to get access to `stdout` with `adb` using `adb shell stop; adb shell setprop log.redirect-stdio true; adb shell start`, but this is definitely not ideal.

Instead, Android provides a [Logging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat.html) system that we can use to write out debugging information, and which is automatically accessible over the `adb` (Android Debugging Bridge). Logged messages can be filtered, categorized, sorted, etc. Logging can also be disabled in production builds for performance reasons (though it often isn't).

To perform this logging, we'll use the [`android.util.Log`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html) class. This class includes a number of `static` methods, which all basically wrap around `println` to print to the device's log file, which is then accessible through the `adb`.

- Remember to import the `Log` class!

The device's log file is stored persistantly... sort of. It's a 16k file, but it is shared across the _entire_ system. Since every single app and piece of the system writes to it, it fills up fast. Hence filtering/searching becomes important, and you tend to watch the log (and debug your app) in real time!

### Log Methods
`Log` provides methods that correspond to different level of priority (importance) of the messages being recorded. From low to high priority:

- **`Log.v()`**: VERBOSE output. This is the most detailed, for everyday messages. This is often the go-to, default level for logging.

	Ideally, `Log.v()` calls should only be compiled into an application during development, and removed for production versions.

- **`Log.d()`**: DEBUG output. This is intended for lower-level, less detailed messages (but still code-level, that is referring to specific programming messages).

	These messages can be compiled into the code but are removed at runtime in production builds through Gradle.

- **`Log.i()`**: INFO output. This is intended for "high-level" information, such at the user level (rather than specifics about code)
- **`Log.w()`**: WARN output. For warnings
- **`Log.e()`**: ERROR output. For errors
- Also if you look at the API... `Log.wtf()`!

These different levels are used to help "filter out the noise". So you can look just at errors, at errors and warnings, at error, warn, and info... all the way down to seeing _everything_ with verbose. A huge amount of information is logged, so filtering really helps!

Each `Log` method takes two `Strings` as parameters. The second is the message to print. The first is a "tag"&mdash;a String that's prepended to the output which you can search and filter on. This tag is usually the App or Class name (e.g., "AndroidDemo", "MainActivity"). A common practice is to declare a `TAG` constant you can use throughout the class:

```java
private static final String TAG = "MainActivity";
```

### Logcat
You can view the logs via `adb` (the debugging bridge) and a service called `Logcat` (from "log" and "conCATenation", since it concats the logs). The easiest way to check Logcat is to use Android Studio. The Logcat browser panel is usually found at the bottom of the screen after you launch an application. It "tails" the log, showing the latest output as it appears.

You can use the dropdown box to filter by priority, and the search box to search (e.g., by tag if you want). Android Studio also lets you filter to only show the current application, which is hugely awesome. Note that you may see a lot of Logs that you didn't produce, including possibly Warnings (e.g., I see a lot of stuff about how OpenGL connects to the graphics card). _This is normal_!

It is also possible to view Logcat through the command-line using `adb`, and includes complex filtering arguments. See [Logcat Command-line Tool](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.html) for more details.

___Demo:___ And now we can finally log out some of the Lifecycle callbacks to see them being executed!

- Start by implementing `onResume()`. Note the wonders of tab completion! Have it log out at `INFO` level. On the device, hit the main `menu` (circle) button to send the Activity to the background, and watch the callback be executed.
- Implement `onStop()` and switch out of the app to watch it be stopped.
- `onDestroy()` can easily be called if you set the phone to "Don't Keep Activities" (at bottom of developer settings). Or you can simply _rotate_ the phone (which causes the Activity to be destroyed and then recreated in the new orientation).
- Something else to test: Cause the app to throw a runtime `Exception` in one of the handlers. For example, you could make a new local array and try to access an item out of bounds. Or just `throw new RuntimeException()` (which is slightly less interesting). _Can you see the **Stack Trace** in the logs?_

<!--#### BREAK 5mins, resume 11:45 latest-->

## Basic Events `r #[10min]`
Once you can "output" some content (via Log), the next step is to add some "input" via an interface element: for example, a Button we can click.

In **`res/layouts/activity_main.xml`** (the Activity's layout), add the following code inside the  `<android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout>` element, **replacing** the current `<TextView>` element.

```xml
<Button
   android:id="@+id/my_button"
	 android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	 android:layout_height="wrap_content"
	 android:text="Start Activity"
	 />
```

This XML defines a Button. The `android:text` attribute specifies the text that is on the button. The next lecture will describe in more detail how exactly this XML works (and what's is meant by the `id`, and `layout_width/height`), but you should be able to make a pretty good educated guess based on the names.

- Defining this in XML is basically the same process as creating the `JButton` and adding it to the `JFrame` in Java!

Now we have a button, but we want to be able to click on it. So we need to register a "listener" for it (in Java), just like with Swing apps:

```java
Button button = (Button)findViewById(R.id.my_button);
button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
   public void onClick(View v) {
	    // Perform action on click
   }
});
```

First we need to get access to a variable that represents that Button we defined in the XML. The `findViewById()` method "finds" the appropriate XML element with the given `id`. We discuss why we wrote the parameter as `R.id.my_button` in the next lecture tomorrow. Note that this method returns a `View`, so we want to **cast** the value into the more specific `Button` (which has methods we want to use).

We can register a listener with that button through the `.setOnClickListener()` method, passing in an **anonymous class** to act as the listener. (Again, tab-completion is our friend!). This is _just like_ what you would do with a Swing app.

Finally, we can fill in the method to have it log out something when clicked.

Overall, this button is an example of an [Input Control](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls.html). These will be discussed in more detail in Lecture 4.


## Multiple Activities `r #[15mins]`
The whole point of interfacing with the Activity Lifecycle is handle the fact that Android applications can have multiple activities and interact with multiple other applications. In this section we'll briefly discuss how to include multiple Activities within an app (in order to sense how the life cycle may affect them). Note that working with multiple Activities will be discussed in more detail in a later lecture.

We can easily create a New Activity through Android Studio by using `File > New > Activity`. We could also just add a new `.java` file with the Activity class in it, but using Android Studio will also provide the `onCreate()` method stub as well as a layout resource.

- For practice, make a new **Empty** Activity called `SecondActivity`. You shuld edit this Activity's layout resource so that the `<TextView>` displays an appropriate message.

Importantly, for every Activity we make, an entry gets added to the **Manifest** file `AndroidManifest.xml`. This file acts like the _"table of contents"_ for our application, telling the device Operating System information about what our app looks (that is, what Activities it has) like so that the OS can open appropriate Activities as needed.

Activities are listed as `<activity>` elements nested in the `<application>` element. If you inspect the file you will be able to see an element representing the first `MainActivity`; that entry's child elements will be discussed later.

- We can add `android:label` attributes to these `<activity>` elements in order to give the Activities nicer display names (e.g., in the ActionBar).

### Intents and Context
In Android, we don't start new Activities by instantiating them (remember, _we never instantiate Activities_!). Instead, we send the operating system a message requesting that the Activity perform a particular action (i.e., start up and display on the screen). These messages are called [**Intents**](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html), and are used to communicate between app components like Activities. The Intent system allows Activities to communicate, even though they don't have references to each other (we can't just call a method on them).

- I don't have a good justification for the name, other than Intents announce an "intention" for the OS to do something (like start an Activity)

- You can think of Intents as like _envelopes_: they are addressed to a particular target (e.g., another Activity&mdash;or more properly a [`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html)), and contain a brief message about what to do.

An [`Intent`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html) is an object we _can_ instantiate: for example, we can create a `new Intent` in the event handler for when we click the button on `MainActivity`. The `Intent` class has a number of different cnstructors, but the one we'll start with looks like:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
```

The second parameter to this constructor is the _class_ we want to send the Intent to (the `.class` property fetches a reference to the class type; this is metaprogramming!). Effectively, it is the "address" on the envelop for the message we're sending.

The first parameter refers to the current [**Context**](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html) in which the message should be delivered. `Context` is an **abstract class** (and a superclass of `Activity`) that acts as a reference for information about the current running environment: it represents environmental data (information like "What OS is running? Is there a keyboard plugged in?"). You can _almost_ think of the Context as representing the "Application", though it's broader than that ([`Application`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html) is actually a subclass of `Context`!)

The Context is _used_ to do "application-level" actions: mostly working with resources (accessing and loading them), but also communicating between Activities like we're doing now. Effectively, it lets us refer to the state in which we are running: the "context" for our code (e.g., "where is this occurring?"). It's a kind of _reflection_ or meta-programming, in a way.

There are a couple of different kinds of Contexts we might wish to refer to:

- The Application context (e.g., an `Application` object) references the state of the entire application. It's basically the Java object that is built out of the `<application>` element in the Manifest (and so contains that level of information).

- The Activity context (e.g., an `Activity` object) that references the state of that Activity. Again, this roughly corresponds to the Java objects created out of the  `<activity>` tags from the Manifest.

Each of these `Context` objects exist for the life of its respective component: that is, an `Activity` Context is available as long as the Activity exists (disappearing after `onDestroy()`), whereas `Application` Contexts survive as long as the application does. Note htat we'll almost always use the `Activity` context, as it's safer and less likely to cause memory leaks.

- Inside an `Activity` object (e.g., in a lifecycle callback function), you can refer to the current `Activity` using `this`. And since `Activity` is a `Context`, you can also use `this` to refer to the current Activity context. You'll often see `Context` methods called as undecorated methods (without an explicit `this`).

After having instantiated the `new Intent`, we can use that message to start an Activity by calling the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#startActivity(android.content.Intent)">`startActivity()`</a> method (inherited from `Activity`), passing it the `Intent`:

```java
startActivity(intent);
```

This method will "send" the message to the operating system, which will deliver the Intent to the appropriate Activity, telling that Activity to start as soon as it receives the message.

With this interaction in place, we can now click a button to start a second activity, and see how that impacts our Lifecycle callbacks.

- And we can use the **back** button to go backwards!

There are actually a couple of different kinds of `Intents` (this is an **Explicit Intent**, because it is explicit about what Activity it's sent to), and a lot more we can do with them. We'll dive into Intents in more detail later; for now we're going to focus on mostly Single Activities.

- For example, if you look back at the Manifest, you can see that the `MainActivity` has an `<intent-filter>` child element that allows it to receive particular kinds of Intents&mdash;including ones for when an App is launched for the first time!

## Back & Tasks `r #[5-10min]`
We've shown that we can have lots of Activities (and of course many more can exist cross multiple apps), and we are able to move between them by sending Intents and clicking the "Back" button. But how exactly is that "Back" button able to keep track of where to go to?

The abstarct data type normally associated with "back" or "undo" functionality is a **stack**, and that is exactly what Android uses. Every time you _start_ a new Activity, Android instantiates that object and puts it on the top of a stack. Then when you hit the back button, that activity is "popped" off the stack and you're taken to the Activity that is now at the top.

![An example of the Activity stack, from Google.](img/activities/diagram_backstack.png)

However, you might have different "sequences" of actions you're working on: maybe you start writing an email, and then go to check your Twitter feed through a different set of Activities. Android breaks up these sequences into groups called [**Tasks**](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack.html). A _Task_ is a collection of Activities arranged in a Stack, and there can be multiple Tasks in the background of your device.

Tasks usually start from the Android "Home Screen"&mdash;when you launch an application, that then starts a new Task. Starting new Activities from that application will add them to the Stack of the task. If you go _back_ to the Home Screen, the Task you're currently on is moved to the background, so the "back" button won't let you navigate that Stack.

- It's useful to think of Tasks as being like different tabs or browsers, with the "back stack" being the history of web pages visited wthin that tab.

- As a demonstration, try switching to another (built-in) app and then back to the example app; how does the back button work in each situation?

An important caveat: Tasks are distinct from one another, so you can have different copies of the same Activity on multiple stacks (e.g., the Camera activity could be part of both Facebook and Twitter app Tasks if you are on a selfie binge). It is possible to modify this behavior though, see
	- Though it is possible to modify this, see [Managing Tasks](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack.html#ManagingTasks)

### Up Navigation
We can make this "back" navigation a little more intuitive for users by providing explicit [up navigation](https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html), rather than just forcing users to go back through Activities in the order they viewed them (e.g., if you're swiping through emails and want to go back to the home list). To do this, we just need to add a little bit of configuration to our Activities:

- In the Java code, we want to add more functionality to the `ActionBar`. *Think*: which lifecycle callback should this specification be put in?

	```java
	//specify that the ActionBar should have an "home" button
	getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(true);
	```

- Then in the **Manifest**, add an `android:parentActivityName` attribute to the `SecondActivity`, with a value set to the full class name (including package **and** appname!) of your `MainActivity`. This will let you be able to use the "back" visual elements (e.g., of the ActionBar) to move back to the "parent" activity. See [Up Navigation](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html) for details.

	```xml
	<activity android:name=".SecondActivity"
			android:label="Second Activity"
			android:parentActivityName="edu.uw.activitydemo.MainActivity">
			<meta-data
					android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
					android:value="edu.uw.activitydemo.MainActivity" />
	</activity>
	```

	The `<meta-data>` element is to provide backwards compatibilit for API level 15 (since the `android:parentActivityName` is only defined for API level 16+).

## Toasts `r #[5min]`
We have previously demonstrated how to use `Log` to output messages to logcat. Logging is fantastic and one of the the best techniques we have for debugging, both in how Activities are being used or for any kind of bug (also `RuntimeExceptions`). It harkens back to printline debugging, which is still a legitimate debugging process.

<p class="alert alert-info">Note that Android Studio does have a built-in [debugger](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/index.html) if you're comfortable with such systems.</p>

However, sometimes you want to check some output/interaction without logging it. You just want to see some feedback while the app is running! Or you want to give a quick message to the user (and users can't normally read logs). Android provides a number of different classes for doing visual notifications, including alert-style and customizable [Dialogs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html), which we'll talk about in a later lecture.

But a simple, quick way of giving some short visual feedback is to use what is called a [**Toast**](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html). This is a tiny little text box that pops up at the bottom of the screen for a moment to quickly display a message.

- It's called a "Toast" because it pops up!

Toasts are pretty simple to implement, as with the following example (from the official documentation):

```java
Context context = this; //getApplicationContext(); //use application context to avoid disappearing if app is closed quickly.
String text = "Hello toast!";
int duration = Toast.LENGTH_SHORT;

Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context, text, duration);
toast.show();
```

But since `this` Activity _is_ a `Context`, and we can just use the Toast anonymously, we can shorten this to a one-liner:

```java
Toast.makeText(this, "Hello world", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
```

Boom, a quick visual alert method we can use for proof-of-concept stuff!

- Note that this code uses a `static` `makeToast()` method, rather than a constructor. This is an example of a Factory method&mdash;a design pattern we'll see a lot!

Toasts are intended to be a way to provide information to the user (e.g., giving them quick feedback), but can possibly be useful for testing too! Though in the end, Logcat is going to be your best bet for debugging, especially when trying to solve crashes or see more complex output.
