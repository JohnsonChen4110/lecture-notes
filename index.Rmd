# About this Book {-}
This book compiles lecture notes and tutorials for the **INFO 448 Mobile Development: Android** course taught at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) (most recently in [`r params$recent.quarter`](`r params$recent.url`)). The goal of these notes is to provide learning materials for students in the course or anyone else who wishes to learn the basics of developing Android applications.

These notes are primarily adapted from the [official Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/index.html), compiling and synthesizing those guidelines for pedagogical purposes (and the author's own interpretation/biases). Please refer to that documentation for the latest information and official guidance.

<p class="alert alert-warning">This book is currently in **alpha** status, as pure lecture notes are converted into more generic formats.</p>
